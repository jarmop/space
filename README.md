# Space

Visualize some star system’s relative sizes and distances. This project didn’t get very far as I soon realised the data available on exoplanets isn’t very accurate. Also all the exoplanet systems seemed to be quite similar to each other with all planets in a very near orbit to their parent stars compared to our solar system.
